          <div class="mt-10 text-gray-400 description">
            <p>
              In 2013, we met as graduate students at TCS, with the mutual dream
              to create new ideas that would anticipate future technology and,
              in turn, newer ways to broaden our horizons.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our entrepreneurial stint began in the year 2015, with the
              creation of BOT on WhatsApp (even before the same messaging brand
              did), which would respond automatically to #tags. And, voilÃ !
              WhatsHash was born. WhatsHash got featured on many well-known
              blogs and news sites, TechCrunch is one of them. ðŸ¥³
            </p>

            <p>
              The idea to integrate businesses on instant messaging apps emerged
              as our companyâ€™s side project in 2015. To build a seamless and
              effective business online, we decided to take things to the next
              level by a brand makeover this year - WhatsHash became Vepaar.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a business app for small businesses, Vepaar is one of the
              emerging WhatsApp Marketing platforms across the globe today. With
              over 3000 happy customers, Vepaar is still 100% founder-owned,
              with more opportunities to maximise profits at every step. Our
              headquarters is situated in Ahmedabad, India.
