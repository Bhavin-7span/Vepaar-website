              A Gujarati word, Vepaar, means ‘business’. As everyone knows,
              Gujaratis are known for having a knack for business, and for this
              reason, our brand name symbolizes our mission. And the mission is
              to assist small and medium businesses in taking their business
              online.

            <p>
              It was the year 2013, and the lot met at TCS with a graduate
              degree in hand and a dream to come up with ideas that would
              forecast future technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our spell as entrepreneurs began back in 2015 when we created BOT
              on WhatsApp, which was surprisingly created before the messaging
              brand itself did so. This BOT would respond automatically to
              hashtags, and this is how WhatsHash came to life. The new company
              got promoted on several websites and blogs, including the likes of
              TechCrunch.
            </p>

            <p>
              This idea to integrate businesses into messaging apps came up back
              in 2015. However, this year we decided to take things up a notch
              and give our firm a brand makeover, and thus, WhatsHash got
              renamed Vepaar.
            </p>

            <p>
              With over 3000 happy customers, Vepaar is easily one of the nicely
              emerging WhatsApp Marketing platforms today. Still fully
              founder-owned, we look forward to every opportunity wherein we get
              to maximize our profits. The headquarters of Vepaar is located in
              Ahmedabad, India.
